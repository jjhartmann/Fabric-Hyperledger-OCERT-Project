# Structure 
* **ocert**: Ocert package that implements ElGamal rerandomization encryption, structure-preserving signature and non-interactive zero knowledge proof system, as well as ocert main scheme.
    * **types.go**: This file contains all the `struct`s used in our protocol, as well as printing(`Print()`), equality(`Equals()`), encoding(`Bytes()`) and decoding(`SetBytes()`) functions for `struct`s.
    * **test\_types.go**: Test for printing, equality, encoding and decoding function for proof of knowledge $$\pi$$.
    * **params.go**: `GenerateSharedParams()` in this file is used to generate the bilinear group used through all schemes.
    * **proof.go**: Includes the zero-knowledge proof generation and verification functions for all five equations required to generate a single **OCERT**. The proof is generated by calling the `ProveEquation{i}()` functions where `{i}` represents the index for the 5 equations from 1-5 (i.e. for the first equation, `ProveEquation1()`). Similarly for verification, the function `VerifyEquation{i}()` is called where the index is replaced by the equation number being verified. 
    * **test\_proof.go**: Includes test functions that validate and ensure the proof generation and verification is correct.
    * **rmatrix.go**: Outputs a matrix of some provided dimension in a requested bilinear group. Handles multiplication across bilinear group pairs in group $$B$$ and multiplication across the integer group $$Z_p^*$$
    * **test\_rmatrix.go**: This includes test functions to test the methods in rmatrix.go.
    * **rerandomization.go**: This file implements the El-Gamal encryption scheme for re-randomization. It includes the functions for generation of public key \& secret key (`EKeyGen()`), encryption of the client id with pseudonym P returned (`EEnc()`), re-randomization of the pseudonym (`ERerand()`), decryption of the client's real identity based on the pseudonym of the client (`EDec()`) , and validation of the pseudonym generated during re-randomization (`ERerandVerify()`).
    * **test\_rerandomization.go**: This file provides tests for generation of key, encryption, decryption, re-randomization and verification of re-randomization. 
    * **structure\_preserving.go**: The structure-preserving signature is implemented in this file, including three algorithms `SKeyGen()`, `SSign()` and `SVerify()`.
    * **test\_structure\_preserving.go**: Test for structure-preserving signature scheme.
    * **stub\_wrapper.go**: An abstract interface that wraps **Hyperledger Fabric** `shim. ChaincodeStubInterface`, so we can test our main protocol without starting the network.
    * **certificate.go**: The function used to generate X.509 certificate should be included in this file in future. 
    * **ocert\_scheme.go**: Main protocol, including three main algorithms `Setup()`, `GenECert()` and `GenOCert()`, and some helper functions like `Get()`, `GetSharedParams()` and `GetAuditorKeypair()`.
* ***chaincode/ocert.go***: The script that run in **Hyperledger Fabric** network, which is based on ***ocert\_scheme.go***. It implements `Init` and `Invoke` chaincode functions, and provides functions like `GenECert` and `GenOCert` to the client.
